The high penetration VKS round can penetrate up to 16 mm (0.63 in) of steel at 200 metres (220 yd) or body armor up to GOST 5 or NIJ III at 100 metres (110 yd). The accuracy of this cartridge when loaded with precision VKS bullets is claimed to be one MOA at 100 metres (110 yd) up to the effective range limit of 600 metres (660 yd).[1] Despite being chambered in the same cartridge, the ShAK-12 would not be able to feed or chamber rounds designed for the VKS due to significant length differences in the bullet component of the cartridge and thus requires its own, shorter, loads. The ShAK-12 rounds have less range compared to the VKS with the maximum effective range of the loads reaching in between 100 and 300 metres (110 and 330 yd)"
